# TravelInspiration

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/travel_inspiration`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

This Ruby Gem provides a CLI to view 12 travel inspiration themes, sourced from [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/) website. Users can choose a theme and view the top 6 destinations, and drill-down to see more details of each destination. 

## Installation
<!--
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'travel_inspiration'
```-->

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install travel_inspiration

## Usage

```gem install travel_inspiration```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
